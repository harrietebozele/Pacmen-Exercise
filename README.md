<img src="PacMan1.png">
This is a simple exercise curated to make a pacman factory and watch them move back and forth from one end of the screen to the other. When the "Add PacMan" button is pressed, a pacman is added on to the screen, and you can click that button as much as you like to create as many pacmen as you want on the screen. Then, when the "start game" button is pressed, the pacmen will move back and forth from the beginning to the end of the screen, changing direction once they reach the end of the screen.
to position the new pacman image and add it to the "game" div. It is then added to the array of pacmen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each pacman.
